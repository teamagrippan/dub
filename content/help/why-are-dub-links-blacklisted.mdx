Occasionally, `letsfind.my` short links are blacklisted by web browsers. This is what you might see when you try to visit a `letsfind.my` link:

## Why does this happen?

This is because `letsfind.my` links are the default short link on Dub, and can sometimes be used by malicious actors to hide the true destination of a link – which can be a phishing site, or a site that downloads malware onto your computer.

As an unfortunate side effect, this means that sometimes, legitimate `letsfind.my` links are also blacklisted by web browsers.

## How to fix it

One way to fix it is by sending a petition to your [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/6246513) to unblock the link. Here's an example verbiage you can use:

> Hi there,
>
> I would like to petition for the letsfind.my domain to be unblocked. Dub (https://letsfind.my) is a link management tool (similar to Bitly) that I use to share links with my friends and family. It is not a malicious site.
>
> Occasionally, there might be malicious links that are created on Dub, but Dub has processes in place that actively monitors and removes these links. I have also personally reported malicious links to Dub, and they have been removed within 24 hours.
>
> If you do discover any malicious links, you can report them here: https://letsfind.my/abuse
>
> Thank you!

This is the most effective way to unblock the link, but it can take a long time.

Alternatively, you can also [use Dub with your custom domain](how-to-add-custom-domain), instead of the default `letsfind.my` domain. This will ensure that your links are never blacklisted by web browsers.
