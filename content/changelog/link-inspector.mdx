You can now inspect short links on Dub by adding a `+` sign to the end of the short link.

For example, if you want to inspect the short link `https://letsfind.my/github`, you can visit `https://letsfind.my/github+` to see the destination URL for the short link.

You can also report a short link if you think it is malicious or spam â€“ [learn more](/help/article/how-to-check-link-destination#reporting-a-malicious-link).
